# 🔍 TensorFlow 2.X implementation of Learning Rate Finder
> A TensorFlow 2.X implementation of the learning rate finder approach, published in paper _Cyclical learning rates for training neural networks_.

## Overview
Example notebook demonstrating how to implement the learning rate finder method ([`lr_finder`](https://fastai1.fast.ai/callbacks.lr_finder.html) in `fastai`) using the TensorFlow 2.X API and callback methods. Demonstrated using the [👕Fashion MNIST 👗](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.


## Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.X
- 🔶 TensorFlow 2.X
